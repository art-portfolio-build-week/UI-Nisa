          <h3>Cool Feature</h3>
          <p>
            That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want -
            and I can make this world as happy as I want it. You're the greatest
            thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so
            very special. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of
            Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Only think about one thing
            at a time. Don't get greedy.

          <h3>Cool Feature 2.0</h3>
          <p>
            No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. This is probably the
            greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. You create the dream -
            then you bring it into your world. There he comes. How do you make a
            round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day.
            Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't
            have to spend any time working or worrying.

          <h3>Cool Things</h3>
          <p>
            Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. There is
            immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in
            nature. We can fix anything. It just happens - whether or not you
            worried about it or tried to plan it. But they're very easily killed.
            Clouds are delicate. And maybe a little bush lives there.
